# Yolo-v3 and Yolo-v2 for Windows and Linux
### (neural network for object detection) - Tensor Cores can be used on [Linux](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-compile-on-linux) and [Windows](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-compile-on-windows-using-vcpkg)

### Requirements

* Windows or Linux
* **CMake >= 3.8** for modern CUDA support: https://cmake.org/download/
* **CUDA 10.0**: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive (on Linux do [Post-installation Actions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions))
* **OpenCV >= 2.4**: use your preferred package manager (brew, apt), build from source using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) or download from [OpenCV official site](https://opencv.org/releases.html) (on Windows set system variable `OpenCV_DIR` = `C:\opencv\build` - where are the `include` and `x64` folders [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096485/53249516-5130f480-36c9-11e9-8238-a6e82e48c6f2.png))
* **cuDNN >= 7.0 for CUDA 10.0** https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive (on **Linux** copy `cudnn.h`,`libcudnn.so`... as desribed here https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html#installlinux-tar , on **Windows** copy `cudnn.h`,`cudnn64_7.dll`, `cudnn64_7.lib` as desribed here https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html#installwindows )
* **GPU with CC >= 3.0**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported
* on Linux **GCC or Clang**, on Windows **MSVC 2015/2017/2019** https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community

Compiling on **Windows** by using `Cmake-GUI` as on this [**IMAGE**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096485/55107892-6becf380-50e3-11e9-9a0a-556a943c429a.png): Configure -> Optional platform for generator (Set: x64) -> Finish -> Generate -> Open Project -> x64 & Release -> Build -> Build solution

Compiling on **Linux** by using command `make` (or alternative way by using command: `cmake . && make` )

## Trained Weights and Architecture

Architecture for tiny-yolov3 and yolov3 can be found in `cfg` folder. As for the weights, please head to this link to download:
